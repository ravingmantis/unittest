## A very simple example

Suppose you have a file ``biggest.R`` with the following function:

```{r}
biggest <- function(x,y) {max(c(x,y))}
```

To test this create a file called ``test_biggest.R`` in the same directory containing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(unittest, quietly = TRUE)

source('biggest.R')

ok(biggest(3,4) == 4, "two numbers")
ok(biggest(c(5,3),c(3,4)) == 5, "two vectors")
```

Now in an ``R`` session ``source`` the test file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source('test_biggest.R')
```

and you will see output like this

```
ok - two numbers
ok - two vectors
```

and that's it.

Now each time you edit ``biggest.R`` re-sourcing ``test_biggest.R``
reloads your function and runs your unit tests.
