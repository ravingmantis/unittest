## A very simple example

Suppose you have the following function:

```{r}
biggest <- function(x,y) {max(c(x,y))}
```

To test this you could do something like this in an ``R`` session:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(unittest)

biggest <- function(x,y) {max(c(x,y))}

ok(biggest(3,4) == 4, "two numbers")
ok(biggest(c(5,3),c(3,4)) == 5, "two vectors")
```

and you will see output like this

```
ok - two numbers
ok - two vectors
```

and that's it.

Now each time you edit the ``biggest()`` function
you rerun your unit tests.

## Comparing results

Suppose our ``biggest`` function was broken, for example:

```{r}
biggest <- function(x,y) { 4 }
```

Our tests from earlier would return:

```
ok - two numbers
not ok - two vectors
# Test returned non-TRUE value:
# [1] FALSE
```

It would be more useful if we saw what ``biggest()`` actually returned, to help
work out the problem.

To help with this we can use ``ut_cmp_equal``. If we rewrite our test to:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ok(ut_cmp_equal(biggest(3,4), 4), "two numbers")
ok(ut_cmp_equal(biggest(c(5,3),c(3,4)), 5), "two vectors")
```

Now the test output shows what we did get (in red) and what we expected (in green):

<pre>
ok - two numbers
not ok - two vectors
# Test returned non-TRUE value:
# Mean relative difference: 0.25
# --- biggest(c(5, 3), c(3, 4))
# +++ 5
# [1] <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">[-4-]</span><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">{+5+}</span>
</pre>

This is particularly useful when there are many values returned:

<pre>
> ok(ut_cmp_equal(c(1,2,3,4,5), c(1,8,8,4,5)))
not ok - ut_cmp_equal(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), c(1, 8, 8, 4, 5))
# Test returned non-TRUE value:
# Mean relative difference: 2.2
# --- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# +++ c(1, 8, 8, 4, 5)
# [1] 1 <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">[-2 3-]</span><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">{+8 8+}</span> 4 5
</pre>
